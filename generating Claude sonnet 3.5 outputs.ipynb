      "\n",
      "One blustery night, rain lashed against the windows. By morning, Eliza was sure the ivy would be bare. But as weak sunlight filtered into her room, she gasped. There, defying nature, hung a single green leaf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Day after day, the leaf held fast. Eliza's strength gradually returned, her hope rekindled by its persistence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weeks later, she learned the truth. Behrman, a failed artist, had ventured out that stormy night to paint his masterpiece â€“ a lone leaf that had given Eliza the will to live.\n",
